Overview
In this project, I combined Python for the backend logic and HTML for the front-end user interface. The core functionality involves training a machine learning model to predict flower species based on inputs provided by the user. The model is based on the famous Iris dataset, which contains information about different flower species.

Features
Flower Species Prediction: Given features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, the model predicts the species of the flower.
Interactive Web Interface: The front-end interface allows users to input flower measurements and get real-time predictions.
Model: The project uses a machine learning algorithm like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Decision Trees for prediction.
Technologies Used
Python: For machine learning, data processing, and model training.
HTML: For the user interface to input flower measurements and display predictions.
Scikit-Learn: A machine learning library used to implement and train the model.
Flask/Django (optional): If you used any framework to connect Python with the front end.
How It Works
Input: The user enters the measurements of the flower’s sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width into the web interface.
Model Prediction: After receiving the input, the Python backend processes the data using the trained machine learning model and predicts the flower’s species.
Output: The prediction is displayed on the web page with details about the species.

Installation
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-prediction-project.git

2.Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Flask/Django app:
python app.py


4.Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the appropriate URL) to use the application

Example Use Case
A user wants to predict the species of a flower. They input values like petal length and width, and the model predicts whether the flower is, for example, an Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica.
